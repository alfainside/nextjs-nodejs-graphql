   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:

   npm run start
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```

### Access the Application
- Open your web browser and navigate to:
  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Notes
- Ensure both backend and frontend servers are running for the application to work as expected.
- Verify that no other services are using port 3000 to avoid conflicts with the frontend server.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter errors during `npm install`, ensure that your Node.js and npm versions are compatible.
- For backend server issues, check the logs in the terminal where `npm run start` was executed.
- For frontend issues, ensure the backend server is running and accessible.
