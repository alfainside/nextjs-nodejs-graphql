# Maintenance Requests Application

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14.x or higher recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Running the Application

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd maintenance-requests-backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd maintenance-requests-frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Access the Application
- Open your web browser and navigate to:
  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Notes
- Ensure both backend and frontend servers are running for the application to work as expected.
- Verify that no other services are using port 3000 to avoid conflicts with the frontend server.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter errors during `npm install`, ensure that your Node.js and npm versions are compatible.
- For backend server issues, check the logs in the terminal where `npm run start` was executed.
- For frontend issues, ensure the backend server is running and accessible.

=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
